**Arcade Review Stats** -

Alos includes useful stats such as current time at HQ, sessions reviewed in the past 30 minutes, sessions completed in the past 30 minutes and more!

**The Arcade Journal** - 
I found out about Hack Club because of Arcade. I hope Arcade has been as impactful and enjoyable for you as it has been for me. To express our collective gratitude, I've created a journal website where you can write your own thank you messages. Together, we can create a digital 'thank you card' to show our appreciation to the staff, volunteers, and everyone who made Arcade possible.
