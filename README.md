**Arcade Review Stats** - 
Scraps the official airtable review stats webpage every 5 minutes and saves the data. It then shows the data in a graph. Super helpful to see how the reviews are going. Alos includes useful stats such as current time at HQ, sessions reviewed in the past 30 minutes, sessions completed in the past 30 minutes and more!

**Arcade Tracker** - 
Input your ticket goal, how many tickets you currently have, plus how many hours you can work and it will automatically calcualte how many hours you need to complete per day to reach your goal! Also has many other useful insights such as a progress bar with where you should be to reach your goal and where you are currently at.

**The Arcade Journal**
I found out about Hack Club because of Arcade. I hope Arcade has been as impactful and enjoyable for you as it has been for me. To express our collective gratitude, I've created a journal website where you can write your own thank you messages. Together, we can create a digital 'thank you card' to show our appreciation to the staff, volunteers, and everyone who made Arcade possible.

**The Arcade Countdown**
The grand countdown until Arcade is over!!! (with live chat!!)
